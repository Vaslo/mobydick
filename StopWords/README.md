### Stop Word Files

1. **ND_Stop_Words_Generic.txt** - Obvious stop words to remove (a, the, was...)
2. **ND_Stop_Words_Names.txt** - Most common surnames (Williams, Jones, Miller...)
3. **ND_Stop_Words_DatesandNumbers.txt** - Financial-related terms (thousands, millions, quarter...)

We can probably combine these into one file if needed.
